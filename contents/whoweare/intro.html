         <p><span class="sh">WELCOME TO JAPAN by Matt Rosa, Director of Innovations - BAT - Japan<br/></span>
            <span class="bc">Japan is a unique and special place. The sheer amount of innovation that occurs here makes it an exciting but challenging place to work. We'll try and give you some insight into Japanese consumers, but I thought a good place to start would be with the BAT Japan Innovations team - its structure and the people involved.</span></p>
            <p><span class="sh">Building an innovation capability in the Innovation nation<br/></span>
			<span class="bc">A bit of background - BAT is the smallest (JTI has 6X our market share) of the big 3 tobacco companies in Japan, so the challenge was simple: how to grow share against our much larger competition. Outspending them isn't the best use of resources so we decided a more strategic avenue would be to become more nimble and create a greater number of consumer relevant propositions for the Japanese consumer. We brought more innovation to the market quicker than our competitors. And in doing so, we have got closest to meeting the Japanese consumer's appetite for 'the new and different', and quickly became the fastest growing tobacco company in Japan.</span></p>
            <span class="bc"><p>This all has consequences. First of all our desire to drive innovation to the marketplace means that we need a structure that can successfully manage and deliver up to 23 new products a year. It also means we need a capability to continually fill a pipeline of new ideas.</p>
            <p>The other piece of background is that operationally we are in quite a unique situation. Our manufacturing is based in Reynolds America, not BAT (due to Japan originally being tied to the B&W organization). Therefore we are reliant upon our own internal resources for the purposes of innovation development and manufacturing.</p>
            <p>In order to deal with these requirements of the market and the specifics of our position operationally we have constructed a team that has three distinct roles within it - Ideation, Project Management and Innovations Development.</p>
           <p> 'Ideation' keeps the pipeline full; Innovations Development takes the ideas, assesses, evaluates and develops them, whilst Project Management makes sure everything happens to time and budget.</p>
