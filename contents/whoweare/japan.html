                <p><span class="sh">THE COUNTRY THAT NEVER STANDS STILL</span><br/>
                    <span class="bc">IT MAY NOT COME AS A SURPRISE THAT A RECENT ECONOMIST REPORT FOUND JAPAN TO BE THE MOST INNOVATIVE NATION ON EARTH</span></p>
                <p><span class="sh">REINVENTING OUR DEFINITION OF INNOVATION</span><br/>
                  	<span class="bc">In the west, being innovative means producing something new and original. To western cultures the high points of innovation are revolutionary products like the television, the light bulb or the internet. But that's just not the way it is in Japan. The Japanese term for innovation is 'kakushin' which literally means 'to make something new once again'. Quite simply it is seen as an evolution, and not a revolution. This difference can be clearly seen in the consumer market. In the West, products are admired for their longevity. But the only way to survive in the Japanese market is to continually bring out new variants. In fact, some supermarkets only keep products on their shelves for a matter of weeks and if brands want to maintain their space, they have to offer something new. So in the Japanese market, creating a product is more of a journey than a destination.</span></p>
                <p><span class="sh">TURN YOUR LIMITATIONS INTO A STRENGTH</span><br/>
                	<span class="bc">The environment is also a big influence on how business has developed. <br/>Being a cluster of islands Japan has very few natural resources and relies heavily on imports of raw materials. And with such a high concentration of people living close to factories, the government had to introduce tight pollution controls as industry grew. This in turn led to more energy efficiency and reduced running costs. Japan has managed to turn each problem into an opportunity. And for them, necessity really has become the mother of invention. </span></p>
				<p><span class="sh">FAILURE IS JUST SO YESTERDAY</span><br/>
                	<span class="bc">With markets moving so fast and new products constantly replacing old ones, there's no time to focus on the failures. They are simply part of the product evolution. Each failure becomes a valuable lesson rather than a dramatic business disaster.</span></p>
                <p><span class="sh">TEAR DOWN THE WALLS</span><br/>
                	<span class="bc">The Japanese cultural focus on innovation has led to their businesses being structured to give the innovators all the support they need. The Research and Development teams have access to all the departments, individuals and decision-makers they need to make their ideas happen. And with the barriers removed, they reach their goals faster and produce more ideas.</span></p>
				<p><span class="sh">YOU'VE GOT TO BE IN IT TO WIN IT</span><br/>
                	<span class="bc">However, things could have been very different if it wasn't for some historic decisions. After the Second World War, the Japanese government saw how important manufacturing was to the future of the country. So they invested in areas like car manufacturing and shipbuilding. And in a matter of years they went from having very little industry to being a serious rival to Western trade.</span></p>
                <p><span class="sh">WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING?</span><br/>
                	<span class="bc">Over the years, Japanese consumers have come to want and expect something new. The 'innovate or die' attitude is so prevalent that it forces companies to continually refresh their products. So, in turn, the companies expect fresh thinking from their employees. And they're structured to make these new ideas happen.</p>					<p>So maybe that is the one lesson that any business can learn from Japan:<br/> it's not just about the actions, it's about the belief. And like Japan, it has to start with the leaders. In that way innovation can result in lots of new things for the company - like new opportunities, new markets and new customers.</span></p>
