                        <span class="bc">As early as 1881, Kimball & Co. had signed a contract appointing Mr. Matsuhei Iwaya of Tokyo as sole agent for the company's "Old Gold" cigarettes in the Orient. Iwaya & Co. was well known with their brand "Tengu" series, the low pricecigarettes with their massive advertisements. By the 1890's Japan had blossomed into ATC's (American Tobacco Co.) leading export market with the company's "Pin Head" and "Old Gold" brands proving particularly popular among Japanese consumers.</span></p>
					<p><span class="bc">In Kyoto, Murai Brothers Tobacco Company substituted exported American leaf for domestically grown tobacco in its products. In 1899, ATC targeted to acquire a local manufacturing firm, Murai Bothers Tobacco Co. to produce ATC's cigarettes within Japan and agreed to form a jointly owned company capitalized at a value of US $5 million in which ATC took a 50% shareholding. After ATC acquired 60% of the share hold of the Murai's company, ATC developed the Murai into ATC's main Asian-based operation supplying markets in China, the Straits, and India as well as domestic market in Japan.</span></p>
